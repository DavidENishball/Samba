PROJECT SAMBA

Project Samba is a third-person action game made in Unreal Engine 5.  This github is an excerpt of the project's source code for demonstration purposes.  Actual development of the project is handled through Perforce for the sake of large binary assets.

Highlights include:
- Using GAS for attribute sets.
- A custom Combo system using Nodes and Link assets to build a state machine, determined by what ability is currently being executed on the player.
- Gameplay Effect Volume system, unifying melee and ranged abilities for characters for applying effects to characters that are found.
- Declaration of tags natively in C++.
- Adjust character movement and states through tags.
